1
\[C]Days grew dark, oh God
Cords of Sheol sur\[Em]rounded me
The \[Dm]snares of death came \[G]forth
Destruction had as\[C]sailed on me
And \[Am]in my deep distress
I called u\[C]pon His name
He \[Dm]heard my voice, de\[G]scended d\[G7]own
And saved me \[C]by His hand
\endverse
\beginverse
  \[Am]I will call on \[C]You
  For \[F]You will answer \[C]me
  \[Dm]God hears me, s\[G]peak to \[G7]Thee
  My refuge’s \[C]in Your love
\endverse
\beginverse
2
God is my retreat
I’m the pupil of His eye
My crag, my rock, my shield
My strength is God, in Him I lie
The shadow of His wings
Is now the place I hide
His presence here, my comfort here
All by one simple word
\endverse
\beginverse
3
God I know one thing
You’re the song within my heart
You are a boundless stream
You flow in me to my delight
Oh just fill me now
Satisfaction’s in Your life
I want to stay, here with You
Salvation’s in Your name

Of \[F]all the gifts Thy \[B]love be\[F]stows,
Thou \[F]Giver \[G7]of all \[C]good!
E'en \[Bb]heav'n it\[Gm]self no \[Bb]richer \[C]knows
Than \[F]Jesus \[Bb]and \[C7]His \[F]blood.

Faith, too, that trusts in Him through grace,
From that same love we gain;
Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
The gift had been in vain.
\endverse
\beginverse

We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,
To Thee our all we owe:
The precious Savior, and the power
That makes Him precious too.

Tune: Hymn 166
\endverse
\beginverse
\[D]A certain man made a \[A]dinner and \[G]invited \[A7]man\[D]y;
Sent he his slave to say “\[A]Come for all \[G]things are now \[A7]read\[D]y!”
  Salvation’s \[G]feast
\[Bm]Must have a sinner to \[A]feed.
\[G]To meet Your \[Bm]need You in\[A7]vited \[D]me.
\endverse
\beginverse
By Jacob’s well You waited for me on Your journey;
Came I again to draw; deep within I was thirsty.
  “Give Me to drink”
You asked me, Lord but You knew
You need the sinner to drink of You.
\endverse
\beginverse
I went abroad and squandered my share of your living.
Your slaves in bread abound; with the hogs I was perishing.
  'Shamed I came back;
You ran and fell on my neck.
You need Your son to be merry.
\endverse
\beginverse
A certain king made a wedding feast for his beloved son;
Sent he his slaves to say, “All is ready, the called may come!”
  A marriage feast
Must have a bride to be.
To meet Your need You’ve invited me.
\endverse
\beginverse
Noble king Solomon courted a girl from the countryside, /
Won he her heart and brought her to himself as the Shulammite.
  You became man,
A divine romance Your plan.
To meet Your need You have drawn me nigh.
\endverse
\beginverse
Let us rejoice, exult, and to Him give the glory,
For our dear Bridegroom will come when His wife is made ready.
  Lord with my all
I choose to answer this call.
Amen, Lord Jesus come quickly!
