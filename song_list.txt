Don’t you want to know your God
Now the Lord is the Spirit-that’s how
Splendid Church Life!
I am a Tree
Oh, the church of Christ is glorious
Recall how David swore
But We All, but we all with unveiled face
Never did I dream before
The Church is the Building Up
Burning, burning, we are burning
Fill my Spirit Up
Back in My Father’s House
We have oil in our lamps
Jacob saw the vision of a dream in Bethel
In the holiest place
Jehovah’s Habitation
Now the Triune God
We will sing to the Lord with our spirit
Drink a River pure and clear
The Son of God is in my spirit
Reading the Bible
Lord, I Just Love You. And there’s no one like you.
Watch! Be Ready!
Steal Me Away
The Love Of The Truth
Just taste and see
Christ is the Tree of Life
After breakfast on the seashore
I love the Lord, He is my strength
Noah’s life was one that surely changed the age
I had a Debt
What Made You Die for Me
To the Church of God
Dearest Lord, You’ve called us here
O Lord, Thou art in me as life
Create in Me a Clean Heart
I’ve got a river of life flowing within me
God has called us for His purpose
I want to follow Him
Jesus O Living Word of God
How could a Country Girl
The Love of Christ is now Constraining Me
Now from my heart comes
There’s a Gospel of Today
In this Godless Age
Manna from Heaven
Willing to be perfected
